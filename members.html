						<p class="article-paragraph">David Thomas Jones was born at 20 Leamington Street, Openshaw, Manchester, on 30 December 1945. From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, 
						Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer". Jones was a former jockey-turned-actor who soared to fame in 
						1965 when he joined The Monkees and they embarked on an adventure that included a wildly popular US television show. Unfortunately, Davy has passed away of a massive heart
						attack in Feb 2012 in Indiantown where he lived.

						<p class="article-paragraph">Dolenz was born at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, in Los Angeles, California, the son of actors George Dolenz and Janelle Johnson. He has three younger sisters, 
						Gemma Marie ("Coco"; born April 5, 1949), Deborah (born 1958), and Kathleen ("Gina"; born 1960). Gemma's nickname, Coco, is a shortened form of "Coco Sunshine", 
						a nickname given to her as a child by Micky. Coco was a frequent guest on the set of The Monkees TV show and sometimes a guest performer on records by The Monkees, 
						singing background vocals or duetting with Micky. She often performs as a member of Micky's backing band during his concerts.

						</div>
						<p class="article-paragraph">After a tour of duty in the Air Force, Nesmith was given a guitar as a Christmas present from his mother and stepfather. Learning as he went, 
						he played solo and in a series of working bands, performing folk, country, and occasionally rock and roll. His verse poems became the basis for song lyrics, 
						and after moving to Los Angeles with Phyllis and friend John London, he signed a publishing deal for his songs. From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of The Monkees. 
						Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his eyes; 
						producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered the "wool hat" guy, and called Nesmith back.

						</div>
						<p class="article-paragraph">Peter Tork was a proficient musician before he joined The Monkees, and though other members of the group were not allowed to play their own instruments on their first 
						two albums, he had played what he described as "third chair guitar" on Michael Nesmith's song "Papa Gene's Blues" on their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, 
						bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of 
						The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake". On the show, he was relegated to acting as the "lovable dummy", a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in 
						New York's Greenwich Village.
